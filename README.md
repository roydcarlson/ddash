## Description
DDASH is a distributed networking permissions manager running on the Interplanetary File System ([IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs)) and [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org). It utilizes the web3.py and ipfsapi python modules, among others.

## Why DDASH?
The majority of produced and hosted by academic institutions, hospitals, and corporations is completely un-utilized. DDASH is an emerging protocol for sharing data on the distributed IPFS network and storing permissions on the Ethereum blockchain. In its usual siloed state, data is a liability rather than an asset, requiring increasing energy to maintain and secure as an organization's data grows. 
DDASH turns data into digital assets. Data hosted on the IPFS network takes a life of its own. No longer bound to a single machine, it travels through all network nodes, is effectively indestructable, and can be accessed nearly instantaneously. Permissions are managed via Pretty Good Privacy (OpenPGP) keypair encryption and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Network participants are rewarded with cryptographic tokens to incentivize 

## Ethereum network
DDASH currently runs on the **blackswan** private Ethereum network.
